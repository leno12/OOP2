# Bonus Tasks Description for Assignment 2:

- NON MAXIMA SUPPRESSION FOR SIMILARITY SEARCH - Checks the similarity matches for overlaping. If two matches overlap with each other, removes the match with the higher error.

- LIVE DATA AS LINE CHART - Displays the live data in the form of a line chart, with one line chart per metric. The line charts get updated every few seconds. This feature is displayed in its own tab, so if the user likes the more simple TableView approach from before, he can still access the old Live Data TableView display.

- LINE CHART WITH MULTIPLE SENSORS - Expands the functionality of the line chart from the first assignment. Intead of selecting only one sensor, a user can select multiple sensors. In order to select more than one sensor, the user must hold the CTRL key while selecting the sensors.

- CSS - Over the course of both assignments, a lot of work was spent in redesigning the look and feel of the GUI, particularly with the use of CSS. Since we didn't get any bonus points for this in the first assignment, we would greatly appreciate it, if we get some for the second.
